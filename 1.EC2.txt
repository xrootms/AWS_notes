
1.>There are two types Virtualization type: 
   a. paravirtual  
   b. hvm

2.> types of root devices
   a> EBS 
   b> Instance store

3> Types of EBS Volume & Use cases?
   t2/t3.miceo>- t2 is the family type means particular types of family we have.
   after dot its denotes the particular size of a machine it means how mach ram and cpu is there.
   t2     .  nano
   family    h/w size

4> why we attach IAM role with EC2 machine while creating it?
   This will allow us to upload or perform any opration of the top os s3

5>Types of hypervisors in aws?
  a>zen
  b>nitro

6> How to check shared AMI?
   go to AMI> click Owned by me> public AMI> then > private AMI.

7>How to run systems in EC2 env?
go to ur ec2 dashbord> slect ur reasion > slect ur ami> slect tampleate>
slect ur root partiion device ur vpc/subnet rest of things

8>EBS & Instance storage diffrent> 
if we stop our machine we can not start againe with Instance storage.

9>Will i lose the metric data if i desable monitoring for an EC2 instance ?
no: by default aws holds the metics for 14 days.

12:#Ec2 purchasing optin#
    On demand (which we create & terminate as required)
    spot Instance (those are based on bit)
    Reserved Instance (wheather we run or not we hav to pay)

13:#how we can recover keys to an EC2?#
    -a> detach root volume
    -b> launch a new Ec2
    -c> attach root volume to new EC2
    -d> modify the authorized-key file
               #copy authorized-key from temp to orignal#
               #lsblk
               #mkdir /mnt/temvol
               #mount -o nouuid /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/tem
               #cp .ssh/auth-keys /mnt/temvol/home/ec2user/.ssh/auth
               #unmount /mnt/tempvol
    -e> reattach root volume to orignal
    -f> start & connect orignal ec2 with new private key.
